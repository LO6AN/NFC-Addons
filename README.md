# NFC-Addons
A central repository for the addons that've been made for NFC

This repo is now deprecated. It's just my addons (Logan) for NFC, and it makes more sense for them to be mixed in with the rest of my addons in [here](https://github.com/LO6AN/MC-Addons)

Also, if you're looking for addons, we recommend looking at our forums. You'll always be able to find them pinned to the top of [this page](https://newfrontiercraft.net/board/7/new-texturepacks-addons-community-additions)
